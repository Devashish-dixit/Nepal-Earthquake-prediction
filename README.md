# Earthquake Prediction in Nepal - Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction
In this Jupyter Notebook, we explored earthquake data to predict building damage in Nepal. We went through the following steps:

1. Exploring the Data
2. Splitting Feature Matrix and Target Vector
3. Splitting the Dataset
4. Calculating the Baseline Accuracy Score
5. Creating a Logistic Regression Model
6. Calculating Training and Validation Accuracy Scores for Logistic Regression
7. Creating a Decision Tree Model
8. Hyperparameter Tuning for the Decision Tree Model
9. Plotting the Validation Curve
10. Creating the Final Model
11. Evaluating the Model
12. Communicating Results
